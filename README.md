### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Tirth Patel**](https://www.tirthdev.in), a backend developer based in Mumbai, India.  

I specialize in building clean, scalable REST APIs and backend systems.  
Outside of coding, I’m exploring cloud deployments, containerization, and advancing my skills in modern backend technologies.

#### Projects I’ve built:
* 📚 **Bookstore API** — Node.js, Express, MySQL, JWT Authentication  
* 💼 **Job Portal API** — Node.js, Express, MySQL, JWT Authentication  

#### Currently learning:
* 🐘 PostgreSQL
* 🐳 Docker
* ☁️ AWS
* 🐹 Golang

#### Fun Facts:
* I enjoy building real-world apps more than watching tutorials.  
* I’m always curious about optimizing backend performance.
