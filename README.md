# Hi there 👋

I'm **Tirth Patel**, a backend developer from Mumbai, India.  
I specialize in building clean, scalable REST APIs and backend systems.

Outside of coding, I’m diving deeper into cloud deployments, containerization, and exploring new backend technologies.

**What I’m working on:**
- 📚 Bookstore API (Node.js, Express, MySQL, JWT)
- 💼 Job Portal API (MySQL, JWT, Node.js)

**Currently learning:**
PostgreSQL • Docker • AWS • Golang 

**Fun fact:** I enjoy building real-world apps more than watching tutorials.
